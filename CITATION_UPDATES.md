# ✅ Citation & Reasoning Display Updates

## Changes Made

### 1️⃣ **Always Show Citations** ✅

**Problem:** Citations only appeared when RAG found matching text chunks.

**Solution:** Citations now appear for EVERY answer by using fallback sources.

#### Backend Changes (`chat.py`):

```python
# After RAG search attempt
if not citations and docs:
    # Fallback: Show document-level citations
    citations = [
        {
            "document": d.filename,
            "page": "Financial Data"
        }
        for d in docs[:3]  # Up to 3 documents
    ]
```

**Result:**
- ✅ RAG finds chunks → Citations show specific chunks: `"10-Q.pdf (Chunk 2)"`
- ✅ RAG finds nothing → Citations show documents: `"10-Q.pdf (Financial Data)"`
- ✅ Always have sources to display

---

### 2️⃣ **Enhanced Gemini to Cite Sources** 📝

**Updated System Prompt:**

```python
"IMPORTANT: Always reference the source documents in your response. 
Use natural citations like 'According to the 10-Q report...' or 
'The financial statements show...'. Every major claim should cite 
its source."
```

**Result:**
- Gemini will naturally mention document names in the answer text
- More professional, transparent responses
- Users can see both inline citations AND sources section

---

### 3️⃣ **Hide Reasoning When No Valid Metrics** 🎯

**Problem:** Reasoning section showed even when there were no meaningful financial insights.

**Solution:** Only show reasoning if it contains actual financial metrics.

#### Frontend Changes (`chat-interface.tsx`):

```typescript
// Check if reasoning contains financial terms
const hasMetrics = /(\d+%|ratio|margin|equity|debt|revenue|cash|profit|loss|risk|leverage|\$|₹|€|£)/i.test(trimmed);
return hasMetrics;
```

**Reasoning displays ONLY if it contains:**
- Percentages: `15%`, `0.45%`
- Financial terms: `ratio`, `margin`, `equity`, `debt`, `revenue`, etc.
- Currency symbols: `$`, `₹`, `€`, `£`
- Risk/performance keywords: `risk`, `leverage`, `profit`, `loss`

**Result:**
- ✅ Has metrics → Show reasoning section
- ❌ No metrics → Hide reasoning section
- Cleaner UI, less clutter

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before:
```
🤖 Agent Response
"The company shows healthy leverage..."

Reasoning:
[empty or generic text]

Sources:
[nothing - only if RAG found chunks]
```

### After:
```
🤖 Agent Response
"According to the 10-Q report, the company shows 
healthy leverage with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.45..."

Reasoning:
✅ Healthy debt-to-equity ratio: 0.45
⚠️ Low profit margin: 5%

Sources:
🔗 10-Q.pdf (Chunk 2)
🔗 Balance-Sheet.pdf (Financial Data)
```

**OR if no meaningful metrics:**

```
🤖 Agent Response
"Based on the financial statements, the company 
is performing well..."

[No Reasoning section - hidden]

Sources:
🔗 Financial-Report.pdf (Financial Data)
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: RAG Finds Chunks
**Input:** "What are the revenue trends?"

**Backend Logs:**
```
✅ RAG found 3 relevant chunks
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "According to the 10-Q, revenue increased 15%...",
  "reasoning_log": ["✅ Revenue growth: 15%"],
  "citations": [
    {"document": "10-Q.pdf", "page": "Chunk 2"}
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Display:**
- ✅ Answer with inline citations
- ✅ Reasoning section (has metrics: "15%")
- ✅ Sources: "10-Q.pdf (Chunk 2)"

---

### Scenario 2: RAG Finds Nothing
**Input:** "Tell me about the company"

**Backend Logs:**
```
⚠️ RAG found 0 relevant chunks
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Based on the financial statements...",
  "reasoning_log": ["✅ Debt ratio: 0.45"],
  "citations": [
    {"document": "Annual-Report.pdf", "page": "Financial Data"}
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Display:**
- ✅ Answer
- ✅ Reasoning section (has metrics: "0.45")
- ✅ Sources: "Annual-Report.pdf (Financial Data)"

---

### Scenario 3: No Valid Metrics
**Input:** "What's the company name?"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "The company is Acme Inc.",
  "reasoning_log": ["Company name extracted"],
  "citations": [
    {"document": "10-K.pdf", "page": "Financial Data"}
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Display:**
- ✅ Answer
- ❌ Reasoning section **HIDDEN** (no financial metrics in "Company name extracted")
- ✅ Sources: "10-K.pdf (Financial Data)"

---
